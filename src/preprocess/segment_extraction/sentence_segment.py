- location: He is standing still diagonally to the right in front of a vehicle on a bright, cloudy weekday. The pedestrian's body is oriented in the same direction as the vehicle, with his line of sight focused ahead in the direction of travel
- environment: The vehicle is traveling on a dry, level asphalt road, part of a main road with one-way traffic and three lanes. The surroundings are urban, with both sides of the road having sidewalks. The traffic volume is usual, and the road surface conditions are favorable for safe movement
- attention: Despite being far from the vehicle, he is closely watching and is almost aware of its presence. The pedestrian seems to be waiting or observing something'''
